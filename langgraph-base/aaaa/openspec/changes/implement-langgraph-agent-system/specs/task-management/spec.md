## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Task Lifecycle Management
The system SHALL provide comprehensive task lifecycle management capabilities.

#### Scenario: Task creation and registration
- **WHEN** a new task is created
- **THEN** the system assigns a unique task identifier
- **AND** records initial task state and metadata
- **AND** adds task to the active task queue

#### Scenario: Task state tracking
- **WHEN** task execution progresses
- **THEN** the system updates task state in real-time
- **AND** maintains execution history
- **AND** provides status query interface

#### Scenario: Task completion and cleanup
- **WHEN** a task is completed
- **THEN** the system marks task as finished
- **AND** archives task execution results
- **AND** cleans up temporary resources

### Requirement: Dependency Management
The system SHALL manage task dependencies and execution ordering.

#### Scenario: Dependency resolution
- **WHEN** tasks have dependencies
- **THEN** the system builds dependency graph
- **AND** determines optimal execution order
- **AND** prevents circular dependencies

#### Scenario: Parallel execution coordination
- **WHEN** independent tasks are identified
- **THEN** the system enables parallel execution
- **AND** coordinates resource allocation
- **AND** synchronizes results collection

### Requirement: Resource Management
The system SHALL manage agent resources and task allocation.

#### Scenario: Agent capacity tracking
- **WHEN** agents are available
- **THEN** the system tracks agent availability and capacity
- **AND** maintains load balancing metrics
- **AND** prevents resource overallocation

#### Scenario: Dynamic task reallocation
- **WHEN** agent failures occur
- **THEN** the system detects unavailable agents
- **AND** reassigns affected tasks to available agents
- **AND** maintains execution continuity
