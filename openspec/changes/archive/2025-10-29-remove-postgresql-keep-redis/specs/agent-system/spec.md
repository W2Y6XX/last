## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: State Management Integration
The system SHALL provide simplified state management using SQLite for persistent storage and Redis for caching.

#### Scenario: Workflow state persistence
- **WHEN** a workflow reaches a checkpoint
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the complete state using SQLite database
- **AND** enable workflow recovery from any checkpoint stored in SQLite
- **AND** use WAL mode for improved concurrent access performance

#### Scenario: Cross-agent state synchronization
- **WHEN** multiple agents need to share state
- **THEN** the system SHALL use SQLite as the persistent shared state storage
- **AND** use Redis for high-performance caching of frequently accessed state
- **AND** ensure state consistency across all agents through SQLite transactions and Redis cache invalidation

#### Scenario: State validation and consistency
- **WHEN** state transitions occur between agents
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate state integrity using SQLite constraints
- **AND** reject invalid state transitions through database-level validation
- **AND** maintain audit trail of all state changes in SQLite
- **AND** cache validated state in Redis for fast access

#### Scenario: Redis caching with SQLite persistence
- **WHEN** frequently accessed state data is needed
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide Redis caching with SQLite as persistent backing
- **AND** automatically sync cache changes between Redis and SQLite storage
- **AND** recover cache state from SQLite on system restart
- **AND** implement cache invalidation strategies for data consistency

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Database Support
**Reason**: Simplify system architecture by removing PostgreSQL dependency to reduce complexity and maintenance overhead while keeping Redis for performance.

**Migration**: All persistent data storage will be consolidated into SQLite, while Redis continues to provide high-performance caching capabilities.

### Requirement: PostgreSQL Integration
**Reason**: PostgreSQL is over-engineered for the current system requirements and adds unnecessary complexity, while SQLite provides sufficient capabilities for persistent storage.

**Migration**: All persistent data storage, including workflow states, agent data, and system configuration, will be consolidated into a single SQLite database with appropriate schema design and optimizations. Redis will continue to handle caching and session management.
