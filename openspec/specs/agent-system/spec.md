# agent-system Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-langgraph-agent-system. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: LangGraph-based Multi-Agent System
The system SHALL provide a LangGraph-based multi-agent architecture for task management and execution.

#### Scenario: Agent workflow initialization
- **WHEN** a new task is submitted to the system
- **THEN** the LangGraph workflow SHALL be initialized with MetaAgent, TaskDecomposer, Coordinator, and GenericAgent nodes
- **AND** the system SHALL create a StateGraph with proper state management

#### Scenario: Task analysis and decomposition
- **WHEN** MetaAgent receives a task
- **THEN** it SHALL analyze the task complexity using LangGraph's state management
- **AND** determine if task decomposition is required based on complexity threshold

#### Scenario: Conditional workflow routing
- **WHEN** task analysis is complete
- **THEN** the system SHALL use LangGraph conditional edges to route to either TaskDecomposer or directly to Coordinator
- **AND** maintain state consistency across agent transitions

#### Scenario: Parallel agent coordination
- **WHEN** multiple sub-tasks need coordinated execution
- **THEN** Coordinator SHALL manage parallel execution using LangGraph's parallel execution capabilities
- **AND** aggregate results from multiple GenericAgent instances

#### Scenario: Error recovery and retry
- **WHEN** an agent execution fails
- **THEN** the system SHALL use LangGraph's error handling mechanisms to implement retry logic
- **AND** maintain workflow state for recovery purposes

### Requirement: State Management Integration
The system SHALL provide enhanced state management using LangGraph's built-in capabilities.

#### Scenario: Workflow state persistence
- **WHEN** a workflow reaches a checkpoint
- **THEN** the system SHALL persist the complete state using LangGraph's checkpoint mechanism
- **AND** enable workflow recovery from any checkpoint

#### Scenario: Cross-agent state synchronization
- **WHEN** multiple agents need to share state
- **THEN** the system SHALL use LangGraph's shared state model
- **AND** ensure state consistency across all agents

#### Scenario: State validation and consistency
- **WHEN** state transitions occur between agents
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate state integrity using LangGraph's state validation
- **AND** reject invalid state transitions

### Requirement: MVP2 Integration Interface
The system SHALL provide standardized interfaces for future integration with the MVP2 project.

#### Scenario: API endpoint standardization
- **WHEN** external systems need to interact with the agent system
- **THEN** the system SHALL expose RESTful API endpoints compatible with MVP2 requirements
- **AND** provide OpenAPI documentation for all interfaces

#### Scenario: WebSocket real-time communication
- **WHEN** real-time updates are required for UI components
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide WebSocket endpoints for live workflow status updates
- **AND** support event-driven notifications for agent state changes

#### Scenario: Configuration management
- **WHEN** system configuration needs to be updated
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide configuration endpoints compatible with MVP2 configuration patterns
- **AND** support hot-reload of configuration changes

### Requirement: Monitoring and Observability
The system SHALL provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities using LangGraph's built-in observability features.

#### Scenario: Workflow execution tracking
- **WHEN** a workflow is executing
- **THEN** the system SHALL track all agent execution steps using LangGraph's tracing
- **AND** provide detailed execution logs for debugging and monitoring

#### Scenario: Performance metrics collection
- **WHEN** agents execute tasks
- **THEN** the system SHALL collect performance metrics using LangGraph's monitoring capabilities
- **AND** expose metrics through Prometheus endpoints

#### Scenario: Health check and diagnostics
- **WHEN** system health is queried
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide comprehensive health status including all agents and workflow components
- **AND** support diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting
